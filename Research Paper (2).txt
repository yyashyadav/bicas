Abstract—The speedy growth of data-pushed programs, specially in surveillance and IoT systems, has underscored the
need for steady, green, and privateness-retaining records control
answers. While cloud computing gives scalability, it poses sizeable
safety risks, making it liable to records breaches and unauthorized access. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and
immutable ledger, offers promising answers to these challenges,
yet it struggles with scalability and computational demands while
implemented to high-frequency, actual-time applications. This
research paper proposes an technique to address those limitations
through an integration of blockchain generation with cloudprimarily based surveillance systems. Through a hybrid version
of selective storage and optimized consensus mechanisms, the
proposed solution addresses the demanding situations of latency,
scalability, and privacy maintenance at the same time while
enhancing real-time access control.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Surveillance systems have come to be indispensable in sectors starting from regulation enforcement to company security,
in which they function tools for actual-time tracking and risk
prevention. As those systems grow in scale, so too do the
challenges related to coping with huge volumes of sensitive
information. Traditional cloud-primarily based answers, while
supplying scalable storage and processing strength, are limited
by way of vulnerabilities in records protection, capability
points of failure, and privacy worries. Integrating blockchain
into the cloud-primarily based surveillance paradigm addresses

those troubles, offering a decentralized, immutable framework
that safeguards data integrity and get admission to control.
This research paper introduces Blockchain Integrated Cloud
Architecture for Surveillance Systems (BICAS), outlining its
structural advantages, the security blessings of blockchain, and
the operational improvements derived from blockchain-cloud
integration. Our technique includes a hybrid storage model,
optimized consensus mechanisms, privacy-preserving zeroknowledge proofs (ZKPs), and actual-time clever settlementbased get entry to manage.

we first explore the challenges and current answers inside
the realm of surveillance systems, observed through an outline
of the relevant technologies together with blockchain, cloud
computing, and IoT. We then present the exact system architecture of BICAS, followed through a discussion on its

II. RELATED WORK AND BACKGROUND
A. Blockchain in IoT Security
Blockchain generation has been more and more implemented in IoT networks to decorate protection, a website
with structural similarities to surveillance systems due to the
allotted nature of both. Dorri et al. (2017) [7] demonstrated
an optimized blockchain model for IoT applications the use of
a lightweight, personal community and a Proof of Authority

(PoA) consensus mechanism. This technique substantially
reduces computational fees and improves facts processing
speeds via tailoring the blockchain to IoT’s aid-restricted
surroundings, that’s relevant to surveillance where data must
be processed in actual-time.
B. Decentralized Storage for Surveillance
Mukhopadhyay et al. (2018) [1] explored decentralized
storage the use of IPFS on pinnacle of blockchain for stable
records sharing. Although IPFS improves storage distribution,
its barriers in actual-time records retrieval make it less perfect
for time-touchy surveillance wishes.
C. Challenges in Cloud-Based Surveillance Systems
While cloud-primarily based solutions offer scalable storage
and remote access, additionally they introduce protection risks,
including records breaches, insider threats, and multi-tenancy
vulnerabilities (Singh Chatterjee, (2017) [16]). These challenges compromise the integrity of sensitive surveillance facts
and disclose it to potential factors of failure. For surveillance
programs, in which statistics security and availability are vital,
the centralized cloud architecture poses critical barriers.
D. Blockchain-Cloud Integration for Secure Data Management
Blockchain and cloud integration has shown capacity in
statistics-touchy fields which includes healthcare and finance,
where records integrity is paramount. For example, Shen,
Guo, and Yang (2019) [15] proposed MedChain, a healthcare records management systems that combines blockchain
with cloud storage. Blockchain secures transaction information
while the cloud gives scalable storage. Such integration is
nicely-appropriate for surveillance, where the blockchain can
steady touchy statistics transactions, whilst the cloud keeps the
capability for widespread storage and processing.
E. Consensus Mechanisms for Speed
Cheng and Chen (2019) [3] explored Proof of Stake (PoS)
and Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanisms to improve speed
in IOT-based surveillance systems. While PoA complements
pace, it could introduce collusion risks among validators, that
is a subject when carried out to touchy surveillance statistics.
F. Blockchain-Based Data Integrity

tree verification can introduce processing overhead, which
may additionally obstruct overall performance in excessivefrequency data environments ordinary in surveillance systems.

H. Smart Contracts for Access Control
Saini and Kaushik (2020) [5] applied smart contracts to
automate role-primarily based get right of entry to manage
in surveillance, efficiently decreasing unauthorized access.
However, complex validation rules within smart contracts
introduced delays, which can hinder real-time get right of entry
to in surveillance packages.
I. Latency and Scalability in Blockchain Systems
Traditional blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum,
face latency and scalability problems that restriction actualtime applications, such as surveillance. Cebe et al. (2018)
[13] proposed a lightweight blockchain framework for IoT,
employing Proof of Authority(PoA) to lessen processing time
at the same time as keeping a decentralized systems. This
method, appropriate for excessive-throughput environments,
ought to enhance surveillance gadget performance by improving transaction pace and decreasing latency.
J. Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms in Blockchain
Privacy is vital in surveillance, mainly for sensitive records.
Liu et al. (2017) [18] proposed zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)
and homomorphic encryption for blockchain, enabling facts
verification without exposing actual statistics content. These
mechanisms provide a further privateness layer, that is mainly
valuable in surveillance where get entry to requests must be
demonstrated without compromising touchy information.
III. OUR APPROACH

In BICAS, vital metadata (which includes records hashes,
location records, get admission to logs, and timestamps) is
securely stored on the blockchain, at the same time as big
surveillance files (e.g., video recordings) reside in the cloud.

This selective storage technique ensures that surveillance information is each steady and scalable, addressing the excessive
statistics storage wishes of present day surveillance systems
whilst safeguarding against centralized data breaches.

schemes that require the decryption of facts to perform operations, ZKPs permit us to show the authenticity of records
with out exposing the real content material, a crucial feature
for privacy-sensitive packages like surveillance.

Our architecture introduces real-time flow processing
blended with blockchain’s immutable ledger, allowing surveillance systems to continuously procedure facts streams whilst
storing crucial metadata on the blockchain. By integrating
streaming analytics and blockchain storage, we are able to reap
near-instant data verification for surveillance operations. This
approach notably reduces latency, allowing actual-time analysis of video feeds, sensor facts, and occasion detection, that is

Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism that is optimized for surveillance data. By selecting a limited number of
trusted authorities, PoA enhances transaction throughput while
maintaining the integrity of the blockchain network.

touchy personal facts, ensuring privateness at the same time
as keeping data integrity is essential. In our studies, we’re
integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Threshold
Cryptography within the blockchain to preserve the privacy
of surveillance records with out sacrificing information verification. Unlike conventional encryption schemes that require
the decryption of facts to perform operations, ZKPs permit
us to show the authenticity of records with out exposing the
real content material, a crucial feature for privacy-sensitive
packages like surveillance.
